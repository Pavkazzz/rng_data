Entropy = 3.421872 bits per byte.

Optimum compression would reduce the size
of this 220474 byte file by 57 percent.

Chi square distribution for 220474 samples is 5992723.75, and randomly
would exceed this value less than 0.01 percent of the times.

Arithmetic mean value of data bytes is 38.7822 (127.5 = random).
Monte Carlo value for Pi is 4.000000000 (error 27.32 percent).
Serial correlation coefficient is 0.270918 (totally uncorrelated = 0.0).
