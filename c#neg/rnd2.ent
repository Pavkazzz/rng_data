Entropy = 3.672673 bits per byte.

Optimum compression would reduce the size
of this 383237 byte file by 54 percent.

Chi square distribution for 383237 samples is 7449472.69, and randomly
would exceed this value less than 0.01 percent of the times.

Arithmetic mean value of data bytes is 45.1849 (127.5 = random).
Monte Carlo value for Pi is 4.000000000 (error 27.32 percent).
Serial correlation coefficient is 0.436912 (totally uncorrelated = 0.0).
